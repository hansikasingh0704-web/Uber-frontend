      <p className='para30'>This is a promotional offer and is not a promise or guarantee of future earnings. This offer is available only to new drivers and delivery people on the Uber app who (i) have never previously signed up to drive or deliver with Uber; (ii) receive this offer directly from Uber and see it in the guarantee tracker of the Uber Driver app; (iii) are cleared to drive or deliver with Uber; and (iv) complete the number of trips or deliveries displayed in the guarantee tracker in the city where they signed up to drive within the specified timeframe. Offer <br/> terms such as number of trips or deliveries and reward amount may vary by location. The guarantee offer that you see in the app replaces any guarantee amounts Uber previously offered you.</p>
      <p className='para31'>Earnings from your trips (after services fees and certain charges are deducted, such as city or local government charges) are included toward your guaranteed amount; any tips <br/> and promotions you make are on top of that amount. Earnings from your deliveries (after services fees and certain charges are deducted, such as city or local government charges) and Eats Boost promotions are included toward your offer amount; any tips and additional promotions you make are on top of that amount.</p>
      <p className='para32'>Any payment due will be automatically added to your account after you complete the required trips. Each completed trip or delivery counts as one trip or delivery toward your minimum requirement. Canceled trips or deliveries do not count. This offer is only valid for those who received it from Uber (via an email, an ad, a web page, or a unique referral link) and meet the eligibility requirements. Uber reserves the right to withhold or deduct payments that it determines or believes were fraudulent, illegal, in error, or in violation of the driver terms or these terms. Limited time only. Offer and terms are subject to change.</p>
